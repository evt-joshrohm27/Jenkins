<div>
    If an error is caught, the overall build result will be set to this value.
    Note that the build result can only get worse, so you cannot change the result
    to <code>SUCCESS</code> if the current result is <code>UNSTABLE</code> or worse.
    Use <code>SUCCESS</code> or <code>null</code> to keep the build result from
    being set when an error is caught.
