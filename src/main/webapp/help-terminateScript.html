		<b>This is to support termination activities for anything that should be done in the event that this
			template is marked for tear down.  This is not strictly required, but assists in cleanup if this node needs to make
		    changes outside of the created Azure node.</b>

	<p>Termination scripts work the same here as initialization scripts, but are executed just before node teardown.</p>
